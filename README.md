# Paywall

Developing a paywall system to enhance user-specific data security, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected. This system restricts unauthorized access by preventing actions such as screenshots or screen recording. Additionally, it ensures that only authorized users with legitimate access can view the content, and any unauthorized attempts to access data through shared links are blocked.
